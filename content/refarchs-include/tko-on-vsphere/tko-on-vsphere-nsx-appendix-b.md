## <a id="appendix-b"></a> Appendix B - NSX Advanced Load Balancer Sizing Guidelines

### NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller Sizing Guidelines

Regardless of NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller configuration, each controller cluster can achieve up to 5000 virtual services, which is a hard limit. For further details,  see [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller(s)](https://avinetworks.com/docs/22.1/avi-controller-sizing/).

|**Controller Size**|**VM Configuration**|**Virtual Services**|**Avi SE Scale**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Essential|4 vCPUS, 24 GB RAM|0-50|0-10|
|Small|6 vCPUS, 24 GB RAM|0-200|0-100|
|Medium|10 vCPUS, 32 GB RAM|200-1000|100-200|
|Large|16 vCPUS, 48 GB RAM|1000-5000|200-400|

### Service Engine Sizing Guidelines

For guidance on sizing your service engines (SEs), see [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Service Engine(s)](https://avinetworks.com/docs/22.1/sizing-service-engines/).

|**Performance metric**|**1 vCPU core**|
| --- | --- |
|Throughput|4 Gb/s|
|Connections/s|40k|
|SSL Throughput|1 Gb/s|
|SSL TPS (RSA2K)|~600|
|SSL TPS (ECC)|2500|

Multiple performance vectors or features may have an impact on performance.  For instance, to achieve 1 Gb/s of SSL throughput and 2000 TPS of SSL with EC certificates, NSX Advanced Load Balancer recommends two cores.

NSX Advanced Load Balancer SEs may be configured with as little as 1 vCPU core and 1 GB RAM, or up to 36 vCPU cores and 128 GB RAM. SEs can be deployed in Active/Active or Active/Standby mode depending on the license tier used. NSX Advanced Load Balancer Essentials license doesnâ€™t support Active/Active HA mode for SE.

## Summary

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere offers high-performance potential, convenience, and addresses the challenges of creating, testing, and updating on-premises Kubernetes platforms in a consolidated production environment. This validated approach results in a near-production quality installation with all the application services needed to serve combined or uniquely separated workload types through a combined infrastructure solution.

This plan meets many day-0 needs for quickly aligning product capabilities to full stack infrastructure, including networking, firewalling, load balancing, workload compute alignment, and other capabilities. Observability is quickly established and easily consumed with Tanzu Observability.
