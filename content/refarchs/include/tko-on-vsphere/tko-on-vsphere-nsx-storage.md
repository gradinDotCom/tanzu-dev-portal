## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Storage

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid integrates with shared datastores available in the vSphere infrastructure. The following types of shared datastores are supported:

- vSAN
- VMFS
- NFS
- vVols

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid is agnostic to which option you choose. For Kubernetes stateful workloads, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installs the [vSphere Container Storage interface (vSphere CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) to automatically provision Kubernetes persistent volumes for pods.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster Plans can be defined by operators to use a certain vSphere datastore when creating new workload clusters. All developers then have the ability to provision container-backed persistent volumes from that underlying datastore.
